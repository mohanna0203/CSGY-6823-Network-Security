This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of firewall concepts using Linux kernel modules and iptables.
We have explored various firewall implementation techniques, from basic kernel modules to advanced stateful packet filtering and load balancing

# Technical Requirements
* Linux environment
* Netfilter framework
* iptables utility
* Docker containers for testing

# Implementation Details
The project implements various firewall types:
1. Packet filtering firewalls
2. Stateful inspection
3. Application layer filtering

# Key Features
* Connection state tracking
* Protocol-specific handling (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
* Custom kernel module integration
* Traffic distribution algorithms
* Network segmentation capabilities

# Security Considerations
* Implements both ingress and egress filtering
* Supports network segmentation
* Provides protection against common network attacks
* Maintains connection state information
